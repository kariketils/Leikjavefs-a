<h2>About Us</h2>
<div class="about">
	This site was created by KÃ¡ri and Valgeir. Two students learning programming and creating websites and almost everything that has to do with computers. We decided in this final project we would do a site about video games and everything about them. The site would have been larger and we would talk about more games if we had the time to do that. The home page would have news about new games and updates in them and the sites name would be Sinister Gaming, we have option in the task bar in the home page to sign up or sign in. But unfortunetly nothing happens when you try to login or signup because we have no database to keep the users. In the community site there's a video e3 2016 which is a video game convenion held in america. There you can see the most promising and best games of 2016. I really hope you liked our site and we will be bigger in the future!
